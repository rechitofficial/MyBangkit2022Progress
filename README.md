I've learned a lot about Git and Github through modul Belajar Dasar Git dengan GitHub from dicoding. Here is what I've learned
- Version Control is a way to store version when making change something the benefit is you don't have to store huge amount of data with different version, instead you can just have one file and add a versioning through version control system, it's much more effective!
- Some of the Git features is Git commit, Git add, Git push, Git pull, Git Fork, Git Clone, Git Revert, Git Checkout, and many more!
